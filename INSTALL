BUILDING
********

Make sure you have python3 available and run make in the root of this repository. The makefile should pull the required vadpacker
submodule automatically from GitHub. The built VAD package should appear in ./release directory.

INSTALLING
**********

Place the built VAD package somewhere Virtuoso has access to and VAD_INSTALL it. For example, if you have the default installation,
you may copy the VAD package to ./vad in the DB directory, and execute "VAD_INSTALL('./vad/virt-prom-exporter.vad',0);" using isql.

You may also be able to use the Virtuoso Conductor web-based management interface, and upload the package there.
