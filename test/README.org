* TESTING

  A rudimentary test is implemented.

* REQUIREMENTS

  - A successfully built vad package in ../release/virt-prom-exporter.vad
  - /bin/sh
  - Virtuoso and isql binaries in /usr/local/virtuoso-opensource/bin/virtuoso-t
  - curl at /usr/bin/curl
  - netstat at /usr/bin/netstat
  
  The virtuoso.ini supplied, and the test script assumes default virtuoso ports for SQL (1111) and HTTP (8890), respectively.

  If these ports are already taken, you must edit the appropriate params in virtuoso.ini and override the values for VIRT_PORT
  and PROM_URI with shell variables.

  Most operating parameters can be overriden with shell variables. Perusing the source code in test.sh should prove illuminating.

* RUNNING

  Check that all requirements are met and exec test.sh
